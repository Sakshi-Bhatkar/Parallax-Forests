            <p><span class="first-character sc">A</span>bout ten million years ago, waters worked through the sandstone to the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward. At this time the Amazon rainforest was born. During the Ice Age, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river. Three million years later, the ocean level receded enough to expose the Central American isthmus and allow mass migration of mammal species between the Americas.</p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">The Ice Ages caused tropical rainforest around the world to retreat. Although debated, it is believed that much of the Amazon reverted to savanna and montane forest (see Ice Ages and Glaciation). Savanna divided patches of rainforest into "islands" and separated existing species for periods long enough to allow genetic differentiation (a similar rainforest retreat took place in Africa. Delta core samples suggest that even the mighty Congo watershed was void of rainforest at this time). When the ice ages ended, the forest was again joined and the species that were once one had diverged significantly enough to be constitute designation as separate species, adding to the tremendous diversity of the region. About 6000 years ago, sea levels rose about 130 meters, once again causing the river to be inundated like a long, giant freshwater lake.</p>

              <p><span class="first-character ny">K</span>nown as the “lungs of Africa”, the Congo Basin is the largest carbon sink in the world, absorbing more carbon than the Amazon. Spanning across six countries, its rainforest provides food security and an essential lifeline for indigenous and local populations and serves as a critical habitat for endangered species. Preserving the Congo Basin forests is vital not just for the future of Africa, but for that of the world. Global efforts to tackle the effects of climate change and biodiversity loss will depend on preserving this rich and lush ecosystem. Gabon annually absorbs carbon emissions equivalent to a third of France’s annual total. The Republic of Congo alone absorbs 1.5% of the world’s entire annual carbon emissions.</p>
              <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
              <p class="margin-top-10">However, the area is increasingly coming under threat due to deforestation, environmental degradation, growing populations, and the impact of climate change. Approximately 575,000 Congolese live in forest areas and rely on the fragile ecosystem for their livelihoods, straining biodiversity protections. In Cameroon, food security, land degradation, and droughts are exacerbating conflicts over dwindling natural resources.Climate actions are needed to help countries in the Congo Basin to pursue green, resilient, and inclusive development that allow them to conserve their natural resources while sustaining livelihoods and boosting economic diversification. </p>

              <p><span class="first-character atw">F</span>rom western Venezuela down to northern Argentina and Chile, encompassing the Andes mountains in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, the Tropical Andes is considered the most biodiverse region in the world. This is an even more remarkable feat given that it covers less than 1% of the world’s land surface. Nearly one-sixth of all plant life on the planet is found here, and the Tropical Andes is home to more amphibians, birds and mammals than any other Biodiversity Hotspot on the planet. Its incredible biodiversity includes more than 1,500 bird species, nearly 500 reptile species and more than 800 amphibian species.How does a place like this become home to such diversity of life? The Tropical Andes is part of the longest mountain chain on Earth, and has a wide elevational range, from its lowest point at 1,640 feet above sea level to its highest point standing more than 19,600 feet tall.</p>
              <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
              <p class="margin-top-10">Its proximity to other biodiversity hotspots and wilderness areas like the Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena or Amazonia further contribute to the high diversity of the region. The Tropical Andes contains more than 400 Key Biodiversity Areas, which are sites of global importance to the planet’s overall health and the persistence of biodiversity, including the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. In addition to storing 5 billion tons of carbon, the Tropical Andes is South America’s largest source of water, providing water to the Amazon and Orinoco rivers.</p>

                <p><span class="first-character atw">T</span>he Sundarbans is the biggest delta, back water and tidal phenomenon of the region and thus provides diverse habitats for several hundreds of aquatic, terrestrial and amphibian species. The property is of sufficient size to adequately represent its considerably high floral and faunal diversity with all key values included within the boundaries. The site includes the entire landscape of mangrove habitats with an adequate surrounding area of aquatic (both marine and freshwater) and terrestrial habitats, and thus all the areas essential for the long term conservation of the Sundarbans and its rich and distinct biodiversity.The World Heritage property is comprised of three wildlife sanctuaries which form the core breeding area of a number of species of endangered wildlife. Areas of unique natural beauty, ethno botanical interest, special marine faunal interest, rivers, creeks, islands, swamps, estuaries, mud flats, and tidal flats are also included in the property. The boundaries of the property protect all major mangrove vegetation types, areas of high floral and faunal values and important bird areas. The integrity of the property is further enhanced by terrestrial and aquatic buffer zones that surround, but are not part of the inscribed property.</p>
                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">Natural calamities such as cyclones, have always posed threats on the values of the property and along with saline water intrusion and siltation, remain potential threats to the attributes. Cyclones and tidal waves cause some damage to the forest along the sea-land interface and have previoulsy caused occasional considerable mortality among some species of fauna such as the spotted deer. Over exploitation of both timber resources and fauna, illegal hanting and trapping, and agricultural encroachment also pose serious threats to the values of the property and its overall integrity.</p>
